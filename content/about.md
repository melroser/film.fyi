**What is Film.fyi?**

It's my attempt at minimizing technical debt by having one super gallery of everything ive rated 3 stars or higher in lightroom. Mostly street photography in and around Miami.

This site was made using the open source project Hugo and its design was shamelessly plagurized from the Gallery Deluxe theme from [GoHugo.io](https://gohugo.io)
