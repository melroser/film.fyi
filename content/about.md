# Film.fyi

Posting regularly to the [gram](instagram.com/themelroser) is hard but I would like there to be a place that I can share my work.

Ideally it would stay relatively up to date.

But also be conducive to working in large batches followed by abandonment of the hobby for months perhaps years at a time.

This site is my best solution so far.

My selection process was everything I've rated 3 stars or higher in Lightroom.

They are arranged randomly everytime you visit.
